More: Defining new Dataset
==========================
Process of making a new custom dataset is similar to that of PyTorch. Relevant classes
are :py:class:`bioimageloader.base.DatasetInterface`, :py:class:`bioimageloader.base.Dataset`,
and :py:class:`bioimageloader.base.MaskDataset` (currently only those that have mask
annotation are available).
