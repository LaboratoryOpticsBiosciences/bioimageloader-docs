PyTorch installation
--------------------
This guide is about installing GPU enabled PyTorch python package on Nvidia
GPU with CUDA capability.

I just figured that it is fair to have PyTorch installation guide aside from
TensorFlow. But there is not much to say. Just go to https://pytorch.org/ and
you choose your options in the interactive installation guide and follow it.
