Notes
^^^^^
- :py:class:`bioimageloader.collections.StarDist` dataset is not included here, because
  it is a subset of :py:class:`bioimageloader.collections.DSB2018`.

- :py:class:`bioimageloader.collections.Cellpose` dataset is not included here, because
  it is a complete dataset by itself, meaning that it is not intended to be mixed or
  concatenated with others. It consists of various sources of images, not only bioimages
  but also images of fruits, rocks and etc.
